## üöÄ Quick Start (Local Development)

### 1) Requirements
- **PHP** 8.2+
- **Composer**
- **Node.js** 18+ and **npm**
- A **database** (MySQL/MariaDB/PostgreSQL/SQLite)

### 2) Clone and install
```bash
# From your dev folder
git clone <your-repo-url> aiims-deoghar
cd aiims-deoghar

# PHP deps
composer install

# Node deps
npm install
```

### 3) Environment
```bash
# Copy example env if not present
cp .env.example .env

# Generate APP_KEY
php artisan key:generate
```
Update `.env` with your database credentials and mail settings.

### 4) Database and storage
```bash
# Run migrations
php artisan migrate

# Seed admin user (idempotent)
php artisan db:seed --class=AdminUserSeeder

# Link storage for public access
php artisan storage:link
```

Default admin user (change after first login):
- Email: `admin@aiimsdeoghar.edu.in`
- Password: `ChangeMe123!`

### 5) Run the app
Option A: run backend, queue and Vite together (Windows-friendly):
```bash
composer run dev
```
This uses `concurrently` to run:
- `php artisan serve`
- `php artisan queue:listen --tries=1`
- `npm run dev`

Option B: run separately:
```bash
php artisan serve
php artisan queue:listen --tries=1
npm run dev
```

Build assets for production:
```bash
npm run build
```

- Admin auth routes under the `admin` prefix:
  - `GET /admin/login` for the dedicated admin login
  - Admin area guarded by `auth` and `admin` middleware
- Change the default admin password after first login
