## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Netlify Limitation

**This Laravel application cannot be deployed on Netlify** because:
- Netlify is designed for static sites (HTML, CSS, JS)
- Laravel is a PHP application that requires a server environment
- The application uses dynamic content (notices, events, jobs) that requires PHP and a database

## üöÄ Quick Start with Railway

1. **Prepare your repository:**
   ```bash
   # Make sure your .env.example has all required variables
   # Ensure your database migrations are ready
   ```

2. **Deploy to Railway:**
   - Go to https://railway.app
   - Sign up with GitHub
   - Click "New Project" ‚Üí "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Select your repository
   - Railway will auto-detect Laravel

3. **Configure environment variables:**
   - `APP_KEY` (generate with `php artisan key:generate`)
   - `DB_CONNECTION` (set to `mysql` or `postgresql`)
   - `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_DATABASE`, `DB_USERNAME`, `DB_PASSWORD`
   - `APP_URL` (your Railway domain)

4. **Run migrations:**
   - In Railway dashboard, go to your service
   - Open the console and run: `php artisan migrate`

## üîß Alternative: Convert to Static Site

If you want to use Netlify, you would need to:

1. **Extract static content** from Laravel
2. **Convert Blade templates** to static HTML
3. **Use a headless CMS** for dynamic content
4. **Implement client-side routing**

This is a major refactor and not recommended for this project.
